### ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-dev:3.10.0  
A **NGINX HHTP** Web server image based on [ewsdocker/alpine-nginx](https://github.com/ewsdocker/alpine-nginx).  

A simple, small footprint HTML development tool. **alpine-nginx-dev** provides a simple NGINX HTTP server which can be anchored at any location to serve the HTML content found there.  It's main purpose is to serve a GitHub web document as it is being developed.

**Installing ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-dev**  

The following script will download the selected **ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-dev** image, create a container, setup and populate the directory structures, and create the execution script(s).  

The _default_ values will install all directories and contents in the **docker host** user's home directory.  

**ewsdocker/alpine-nginx-dev:3.10.0**
  
    docker run --rm \
               -v ${HOME}/bin:/userbin \
               -v ${HOME}/.local:/usrlocal \
               -e LMS_BASE="${HOME}/.local" \
               -v ${HOME}/.config/docker:/conf \
